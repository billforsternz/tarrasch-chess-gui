New simple test plan for testing workflow as games cycle through files and tabs
Cycle randomly through following tasks;
1. Play moves to create game
2. Load games from a file
3. Save moves to a file
4. Edit game from a file
5. Load game from a database search
6. Copy games to clipboard
7. Delete games from clipboard
8. Delete games from file
9. Paste games into file
10. Paste current game into file
11. Edit game details
12. New tab, play moves in tab
13. Add tab to file
14. Close tab

Generate 100 random numbers from 1-14 with browserling.com/tools

10*, 8*, 2*, 4*, 12*, 11*, 9*, 6*, 3*, 10*, 10*, 1*, 12, 13, 8, 10-, 10-, 12, 3, 13, 1,
7, 6, 1, 9, 14, 4, 2, 13, 4, 9, 11, 10, 7, 11, 10, 11, 6, 4, 10, 9
13, 6, 11, 11, 10, 11, 11, 5, 6, 2, 8, 10, 4, 8, 8, 2, 7, 4, 6, 11
6, 7, 14, 2, 10, 6, 5, 11, 8, 7, 12, 12, 12, 10, 1, 2, 12, 13, 3, 9
12, 11, 13, 13, 7, 13, 13, 2, 8, 12, 9, 12, 1, 4, 7, 9, 3, 8, 1, 9

Test plan

1) Make moves, File, Save [new file], Ok
   (Problem - "This tab not in file" after save) <-fixed
2) Make moves, File, Save [existing file]
    (Problem - Dialog claims file will be replaced [actually appends] - Probably Mac only)
3) Make moves, File, Save As [new file], Ok
4) Make moves, File, Save As [existing file]
    (Problem - Dialog claims file will be replaced [actually appends] - Probably Mac only)
5) Open file, cancel, quit, Ok
    (Problem, game is allegedly modified, so you are asked to save it) <- fixed
6) Open file, load 2nd game, Ok
7) Use Previous, Next buttons to load 1st and last games
    (Problem, up and down buttons are disabled)
8) Create a pgn file with two Sicilian games, copy them to clickboard, Ok
9) Open an existing pgn file and add two Sicilian games to the clipboard, Ok
10) Do a database search, Calculate Stats, and from the listed games add two more Sicilian games to the clipboard, Ok
11) Check that the clipboard has the correct 6 Sicilian games, Ok
12) Check "Clipboard is temp database", Ok
13) Start a new game, play 1.e4 and do a database search, confirm that 6 games are found, all replying 1...c5, Ok
    (Some problems though
        - Database search is always automatically loading games
        - It says "searching for extra games" whilst doing it
        - No result games aren't shown as draws in stats - actually this is probably a good thing
        - I noticed that if opening a .pgn but cancelling without loading a game, the .pgn is allegedly open
        - If clipboard is temp database when you do a database search, unchecking should do a brand new db search (it doesn't)
    )
14) Create game and save to existing file with one game - on Mac end of first game is garbled? if first game was created on PC?

(Note 14th Oct 2015; Play 1.e4 c5 2.b3 Database -> Calculate Stats -> click on 2...d6 in database pane, then click on moves column,
First 3 games and next 4 games are identical up until 7...g6 and 7...e6 respectively. So why don't the 4 7...e6 games come ahead of
the 3 7...g6 games ?)
