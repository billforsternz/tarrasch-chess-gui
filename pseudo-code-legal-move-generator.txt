/*

efficiently calculate list of all legal moves
 king moves
  for each knight ray
   if its an enemy knight increment check count
  for each king ray
   clear possible pin flag
   for each square
    if enemy
     it may be giving check, or it may be pinning, or neither, then we are done
      checker or pinner based on whether friend previously set possible pin flag
      horizontal and vertical rays - checkers and pinners are from rooks and queens
      diagonal rays - checkers and pinners are from bishops and queens, sometimes pawns check
      if checker increment check count
      if pinner save pinned piece and two pin rays
       a pinned piece can move along the two pin rays (one towards king the other towards pinner) only
       note that because there is only one king per side, a piece cannot be pinned in two or more directions at once
       (Euclid says only one line intersects two points - comprising pinned piece and king).
       diagonnally pinned bishops, queens, and pawns can move on the two diagonal pinning rays
       orthogonally pinned rooks, queens and pawns can move on the two orthogonal pinning rays
    if friend
     if possible pin flag already set we are done, else set possible pinned flag
    if empty and first square
     if the square is not attacked save this as a valid move
  
 if check > 1
  we are done because if double check only king moves are possible
  
 if check == 0
  add castling moves if possible

 normal moves
  if enpassant target, generate up to two enpassant moves
   ignore normal pinning logic, apply simple legality check - is king attacked after move?
  for each square on board
   if friend and not king
    for each ray or if pinned for each pin ray
     for each square
      if friend we are done
      if empty or enemy conditionally save move, then if enemy we are done
       conditionally save move
        if check save move only if destination is on ray from king to checker
        otherwise just save move
