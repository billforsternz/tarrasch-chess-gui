Investigating bug report
What PGN file created V3.13a release tarrasch-base.tdb ?
Confirmed that it's file ChessDatabase\twicbase\compose\tlpgn.pgn
18/11/2020  11:41 AM     2,548,355,636 tlpgn.pgn

  Piwari, Dyland Tama 2118  0:1 Xie, Felix 2003

In Tarrasch's db create dialog box the date for tlpgn.pgn is different - it shows as 15/11/2020 5:33 PM 2,488,629 KB
Windows explorer agrees exactly with Tarrasch's db create dialog box --EXCEPT-- it agrees with dir's time and date
So weird !! Note that 2,548,355,636 / 1024 = 2488628.551 (so agrees after round up)

Some improvements to aim for;
1) Don't keep opening a new tab for every file opened. It's okay if the current tab has been used, but if it's occupied by
and unused (no edits, still starting position) of the first game of a file that's just been opened - reuse that tab.
2) Skip over EF BB BF (unicode BOM - or something) at the start of a PGN file
3) Catch the exception that crashes Tarrasch if an open PGN file is edited behind its back by an external program.
4) Offer to open a shell/command line PGN file after the dialog box (that stopped it being opened immediately) closes.

Improving HTML publishing system. Created program xpm2bmp to help create 36 pixel
squares.

Background colours White rgb=255,255,255, Grey rgb=224,223,227 (!? - we used 224,224,224) Yellow rgb=239,228,176

1 November 2018
Need to more aggressively set current window on opening new style games dialog
File Save game as leaves status in limbo
Promote rest of comment to moves fails on blank board from position zero.

We changed some mouse handlers by adding "Atomic begin" in order to get the
draw counts to update when clicking on a different move;

But why was that necessary when clicking on a different move updated the
position and the window title?

Answer> Problem was that no atomic context was running so status was updated
but ignored. Solution update Atom::StatusUpdate() so that if no atomic
context is running it updates status immediately (not at end of context) -
some (not all) of the other Atom facilities work that way. Enabled removal
of the (only one actually) Atomic begin; previously added to a mouse handler.

Things on top at the moment as we struggle to get a new release out
(last release was V3.03a in early 2017)

BUG Fixed> Check what happens when human comp game ends as a repetition draw
COMPLETE> Why do we need Mouse Event atom instance when Set Manual does atom
COMPLETE> File save game as -> recent files
COMPLETE> Database file in status field
DONT DO IT>Database option in options
COMPLETE (and better than suggested)>Open database file offers to set it to default
COMPLETE> Cancel not default in pop up
COMPLETE> Copy FEN to system clipboard
COMPLETE> Start not Suggestions
Faster move generation
COMPLETE> Remove warnings
Comment before resume from branch
COMPLETE> Cancel in PGN Dialog still loads game
Able to add comment right at end of game
FIXED> Fix bug: Setup a position, play moves, go back and look at it in session
Diagram output
Game output
PGN editor preserves extra tags, let's you edit arbitrary tags
Consistency: Save overwrites or appends to existing files everywhere.
COMPLETE> Investigate Unicode issues
Bug hunt:
Things we did
Hague-Smith was missing in selection; so we pasted moves into new game, added tab to file, edited game details, sorted and saved
Gong-Ang was first game we edited, but opened another file, so tab was orphaned, so opened selection again and added tab to file. Later
we sorted by round and deleted old unannotated version. 
Bug: Promote rest of comment from index 0 in a lone comment doesn't work
FIXED (actually they were modifiable, but improperly restricted)> Bug: move counts in position setup aren't modifiable
Bug: Clear text window on new game
Bug: Delete in text window doesn't delete selection
Promote comment to stalemate (checkmate?) doesn't generate same result as playing out moves.
COMPLETE> Set engine priority lower
DONE> Remove sqlite from build

Older stuff below;
Annoying engine dialog problem first reported by Laocomo / Larry Oliver on 02 Dec 2016 predated Tarrasch V3.01
Problem is that wxWidgets sacrifices the engine picker in a bid to get all 6 UCI parameters (number of UCI parameters
increased to 6 with Tarrasch 3). Larry's screen res wa 1280 x 720

This problem still pops up on V3.03a for some people! including someone with 1280 x 800 (janirv1949@gmail.com)

For V3.05 try squeezing up the custom parameters more.

sudo apt install libwxgtk3.0-dev
wx-config --version
> 3.0.2

cannot find -lwx_gtk2u_webview-3.0
cannot find -lwx_gtk2u_media-3.0

Changes for V3.01a
Add progress gauge when writing duplicate games, also allows discoverability
Do it last - allows users to cancel if they don't need it *
Engine dialog box works on smaller screens
Arrows when number of tabs fills main screen
Heading in frame is the default option
Pattern search - Don't allow extra material no longer the default!
Avoid slowly leaking memory on meta-data as databases loaded or created
Problems with pattern and material balance searches using clipboard as temporary database - fixed
Ctrl-A = select all in game dialogs
Error handling in append database was broken - sometimes (eg bad initial format) leaving user unsure what happened
Slightly more informative can't load database message
Write duplicate pgn file last on db create or append - make it clear it can be cancelled
Never show asterisk = file modified if no current file!

Later
Use faster move generator

Successfully tried a good test
Create empty.tdb with zero sized empty.pgn then append large .pgn to the new empty database
Using T3Database kingbase-lite-2016-03.pgn got a binary match to regen-v3.00a.tdb Woo hoo!

Appending to shipped .tdb
kingbase-lite-2016-03-appended-1  + sites-165.pgn doesn't work to well, only two games added, but games were identical moves and Sitexxx was used for names and Site so maybe not a good test??!!
kingbase-lite-2016-03-appended-2  + wgtn-base.pgn (2177 games, but actually a poor choice - a starting point for wellybase not an end point)
    893026 games so added 2170 games looks reasonable
kingbase-lite-2016-03-appended-3  + wellybase-sites-165.pgn (165 games, from wellybase.pgn [a copy of wgtn18.pgn] with Site tag changed to Site001, Site002...Site165)
    891021 games so added 165 games woohoo, all 165 SiteNNN names at the end seem okay
    Restart with -v flag
    891021 games, 23301 players, 13927 events, 4097 sites
    15 player bits, 14 event bits, 13 site bits
    So one extra site bit added as we shifted over 4096
kingbase-lite-2016-03-appended-4   ;Same as above but with last TarraschDb beta - minimal difference to kingbase-lite-2016-03-appended-4
                                   ;actually, almost bin match and says 4097 sites and 13 site bits - Site164 is ok but Site165 changes to "" (i.e. empty)
                                   ;So when only on run when append breaks limit do we get corruption - subsequent appends will be good (until next power of
                                   ;2 limit reached) - Probably a good idea to check this matches the old buggy code issue as we understand it.

Doing some "after the fact" testing

The kingbase-lite-2016-03.tdb file shipped *does not* match the one currently generated
from kingbase-lite-2016-03.pgn unfortunately. Try to figure out retrospectively how we
got to where we are, and whether we are in good shape.

Added #17714 to wxWidgets trac system.

28/9/2016

New simple test plan for testing workflow as games cycle through files and tabs
Cycle randomly through following tasks;
1. Play moves to create game
2. Load games from a file
3. Save moves to a file
4. Edit game from a file
5. Load game from a database search
6. Copy games to clipboard
7. Delete games from clipboard
8. Delete games from file
9. Paste games into file
10. Paste current game into file
11. Edit game details
12. New tab, play moves in tab
13. Add tab to file
14. Close tab

Generate 100 random numbers from 1-14 with browserling.com/tools

10*, 8*, 2*, 4*, 12*, 11*, 9*, 6*, 3*, 10*, 10*, 1*, 12, 13, 8, 10-, 10-, 12, 3, 13, 1,

bug: Save in pgn dialog doesn't change File modified in status
bug: change to tab doesn't relocate us with blue arrows
bug: change file in file dialog doesn't change tab infile status

15/9/2016

Todo (done)
-----------
Lose the sunken border effect
Doing scandi prep, load game (instead of use game) by mistake. Tried closing tab - crash
Swap sides swaps labels
Got into a situation with Kibitzer stopped and suggestions horizontal - looks bad
Book moves not at far right if maximise
Height of book moves should maybe set notebook width
Board minimum width is controlled by pitch=15
Add duplicate game thing
Layout is non-volatile
Get click on square working again
Improve selection of new database file in create database dialog
Add delete variation command
Improved database icon in toolbar
Show all by player not sorted sensibly within player
Save all doesn't work for show all by player - remove it
Cut, delete, paste should change nbr of games in a list
Claude: Aggressive smaller resize from top left causes crash.
Claude: Start game with engine to move - doesn't say Engine Thinking
Edit colours
Improved anti-aliasing without white jaggies around pieces
Remove small board option
Add Claude to credits.
Bug fix: Cannot initially drag pieces in board setup
Bug fix: Info boxes have weird first paragraph
Clipboard as temp*orary* database
Check all bitmaps have white pieces on left
Change Rybka to UciEngine everywhere
Idea: in database next move pane asterisk moves that mimic the current game.
Dynamic US spelling (basically because of color)
New tab button next to book moves?
Claude: Permissions error moving files to documents
Pickup ratings field from earlier in tournament when entering games.
Get rid of edit game prefix
Bring colours into preview board
Need to get click on players, clocks working again

Todo (not yet)
--------------
32 bit icons
Extra NAGs eg unclear
Can we control multiple instances?
Get close box on tabs
Efficient undo
Highlight colours
Bring colours into setup board
Alt F underlining etc
6 custom commands
Check ANSI names in pgn
Select All in games dialogs
Add more ratings filters
Buttons same width
Ticking clock is red
Claude: Settings, particularly GUI layout non-volatility imperfect
Add Pro-Dao
Do database create and append on top of existing database
Allocate control block frees unused blocks
Append adds extra blank line
6 engine parms instead of 4
pgn column sorting - prompt to load (except col 0), handle cancelling differently
Add stat for how many transpos pulled in when drilling down
Bug: First game of 2015-summer-g.pgn not processed
Check weird ChessBase pgn format supported for both preview and loaded game.
Bug: Make moves, save game (overwrite) - this tab not in file.
pgn_handle not cleared by constructor - check others
e8Q as well as e8=Q
Paste tags
reduce sleep in engine state machine
Bugs:
    Ian's a-file bug
    Training (partial blindfold - 2 move lag) bug
    Undo and move now don't play well together
    a) Paste current game into clipboard (incidentally - if White isn't "" don't put up game details for editing please)
    b) Open a new file
    c) Two bogus save requests ensue.
    Working with a chessbase pgn with unicode intro can leave single line [Event ""] artifacts is file later
    Paste game into current file, edit game details, save - changes not reflected?

git add -u is a good way to tell git to cement changes (like file deletions)

Icon work summary;

We first established that in all of the 370,070 byte icon files generated by convertico.com
the 16x16 pixel bitmap is found at offset 0x8e and comprises 256 32 bit pixels (b,g,r,a) from
bottom left to top right (we did it by blowing up a 16x16 icon from a screenshot with Paint.exe
using the colour editor to observe some adjacent pixels, then scan with a custom .cpp program.

The icon files are now Tarrasch9Squares.ico and Tarrasch4Squares.ico. The 9 Squares version is
ostensibly f5,f6,f7,g5,g6,g7,h5,h6,h7. I say those squares because a typical pattern of a
fianchettoed black bishop, presumably defending a kingside castled black king, is illustrated.

The 4 Squares version is really 2 whole squares (g6 and g7) and 4 half squares (f6,f7,h6,h7).
So g7 (black bishop), g6 (black pawn) and half of each of f7 and h7 (both black pawn).
Half of each of f6 and h6 are transparent cutouts so there is still a T shape. We embed
both icon files in the resource file, Tarrasch4Squares is for small icons, they look better
when we don't try and have the full 3x3=9 squares. We also used our knowledge of the location
of the 16x16 pixel bitmap to patch the Tarrasch4Squares 16x16 bitmap into the Tarrasch9Squares
16x16 bitmap - which is why at small size the Tarrasch9Squares.ico file only has 4 squares.

I will put icon-scan.cpp into a new tools directory so it doesn't get lost.

9/8/2016

Tidying up the 16x16 icon inside of TarraschDb.ico;

We went looking for pixels we could see in adjacent positions. The following
triples are RGB values (from MS Paint's colour editor).
TarraschDb2.ico looking for patterns

for each run of 16 and or 12
    search for each triple
        145,134,113
        246,220,177
        230,182,135
        141,105,76

See program icon-scan.cpp in misc directory.
We found the pixels and determined that the 16x16 bmp is embedded as follows

offset 0x44e = top left. Then each pixel is 4 bytes B,G,R,Alpha, 
top row is 0x40 bytes (16 pixels; 0x44e-0x48d
2nd row is 0x40e-0x44d
3rd row is 0x3c3-0x40d ...
15th row is 0x08e-0x12d

Wrote a little code in icon-scan.cpp to replace the "drunk insect" iconography
(caused by scaling down from 256x256 in convertico.com) with a more precise
version.

28/7/2016
Made a new icon by making a 256x256 png (use adobe acrobat 390% view of a chess mag for pieces)
Use gimp to make transparent panels (easy-peasy - select rectangle and press delete - then export)
Then use convertico.com to make a 6 size ico file from that


Some things to do
Change credit to thanks for the icon idea
move buttons up a pix or two
don't show neg numbers in clock times

3/7/2016

#Fixed/Done
Show all ordered by player - initial slow sort is a worry
Bug: Sort on # column  crashes
Support reserved=hdr length, 0==8
Add stuff from other branches
    including fix for Junior (actually already had this)
    bell on engine move (actually already had this)
    'fixed period mode' a new human v comp timer
Get rid of misleading "searching for extra games" text
Set fixed period mode sets time minutes to 0
Add fix whereby (white) etc is deleted as a suffix
Add #
Make sure searching incomplete games in clipboard handled gracefully
    Bug add game from database search dialog to clipboard and check clipboard search
    -stack corruption near partial after StatsCalculate - unplanned re-entrancy?
    (possibly fixed by above change - observed memory corruption in search due to
    running moves from a game with FEN without applying FEN)
Clipboard search shows "clipboard search" in results
game_id sensibly initialised - database and pgn/user games don't overlap
browse_map cache of positions in each game by game_id.
Identify current game after sort by game_id  to replace Goto(0)
Fix ECO bug (actually - cannot reproduce)
Change sort on column0 behaviour - if forward and already forward - do reverse. If reverse and already
reversed do forward.
Remove compressed database checkbox - replace with elo level plus (ignore
 or both players or one player) plus include if no elos
On create .ini file set default db to largest/latest (actually just specify a specific .tdb - not default.tdb
Better dialog box help
Separate fixed_period_mode times stored in .ini


#For Beta

#Postpone for now
If there is a nasty assert (eg wxALIGN_CENTRE_VERTICAL) then "Yes" to abort the program doesn't work?!
Get rid of edit game prefix
Fix bolded first line of credits etc.
Fix Larry Oliver's bug
Idea: in database next move pane asterisk moves that mimic the current game.
First line of help is bold for some reason (wx31)
Dynamic US spelling (basically because of color)
Add Pro-Dao
Delete variation menu command
Do database create and append on top of existing database
Bug: First game of 2015-summer-g.pgn not processed
Allocate control block frees unused blocks
Append adds extra blank line
6 engine parms instead of 4
pgn column sorting - prompt to load (except col 0), handle cancelling differently
add stat for how many transpos pulled in when drilling down

Retime MemoryPositionSearch with
4r3/3q1pk1/3p1bn1/2pP1ppQ/1p2P3/6P1/r2B1PK1/1R5R w - - 2 42
Got 810ms,811ms,818ms
Compares favourably to the original 855ms,858ms,857ms
We are now checking for promotion and passing that information using
game_attributes, so we are now really doing CORRECT_BEST_PRACTICE.

Did it again a few days later and got 840ms (ish), oh well. Hadn't really
tried any speedups.

Things to do before new alpha release;

Fix odd visualls for stats
Add use arrows comment ?
Update to new kingbase lite?
Auto detect whether to reverse pgn records ?
Use game feature works on empty game

Implement promotion check so search works beyond promotions
Update credits
Update about box
Get rid of Alt-A, Alt-B
Change to TarraschDb.ini .exe etc.
Search on initial position should be faster
Test search algorithm
Doesn't go straight to game if selected (maybe?)
Progress bar doesn't bother if super quick
Fix exception on exit if still loading database
Check game ordering
Implement match on player to move
Goto(0) needs to set focus
* Improved duplicate game algorithm (see below)
* Progress bar on database load
 which requires get game count
* Publish works but Wellington website games don't show


After hooking up MemoryPositionSearch to the program proper, we retimed
4r3/3q1pk1/3p1bn1/2pP1ppQ/1p2P3/6P1/r2B1PK1/1R5R w - - 2 42
using for the moment (at least in effect because we aren't checking
for promotions) NO_PROMOTIONS_FLAWED (not a great name it means
possible false negatives if match after promotion)

We got;
    988ms,1004ms,997ms
i.e significantly worse that 751ms below. Acting
on a hunch we changed DoSearch() to use a const char * parameter instead
of a string reference and then we got;
    765ms,759ms,765ms
Woohoo.

Timing improvements to our fast MemoryPositionSearch algorithm;
4r3/3q1pk1/3p1bn1/2pP1ppQ/1p2P3/6P1/r2B1PK1/1R5R w - - 2 42

Proposed duplicate game algorithm
 White and Black - split into tokens, at least one common multi-char token required for both white and black
 Date - non-contradictory; eg "2008.12.31" matches "" or "2008" or "2008.12" but doesn't match "2007" or "2008.11" or "2008.12.30"
 All other fields - don't care

Bugs
 T icon has disappeared
 Publish works but Wellington website games don't show
 Doesn't go straight to game if selected
 Create small millionbase exceptions out
 End app whilst loading games exceptions out

Ideas
 Cascading ordering

In directory T3Database

The BigDatabase 2007 as .pgn, in 2 parts, original and rebuilt.
giant1.pgn
giant-base-part1-rebuilt.pgn
giant2.pgn
giant-base-part2-rebuilt.pgn

Some twic files we concatentated together to make giant3.pgn
twic_minimal_overlap.pgn
twic-948-1010.pgn
twic-1011-1050.pgn
twic-1051-1077.pgn

Finally concatenate giant1.pgn, giant2.pgn and giant3.pgn
giant123.pgn

Note all concatenations used file 'b' between each concatenated file,
file b is simply two blank lines (4 bytes, DOS format)
